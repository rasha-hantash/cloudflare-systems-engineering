This is a simple CLI tool that makes a request to your links page.
Requests to the page are done via sockets and not through libraries.
The program itself was designed to challenge myself with socket-level programming. 

Usage:
  go run cli.go <website you want to visit>  [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for go
  -p, --profile int   the profile flag
```

## Observations
```
I saw that the average time it took to request a workers website was much faster than requesting a popular website
